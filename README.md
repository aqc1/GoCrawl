# GoCrawl

A simple webcrawler; nothing to fancy.
* Usage: `./GoCrawl -url URL`
* Not a bad idea to sort output: `./GoCrawl -url URL | sort | tee found_urls.txt`

TODO:
- [ ] Clean Up Code
- [ ] Find a Way to Optimize Finding URLs, Checking of URL was Already Found, etc.
- [x] ~~Add Option to Output to a File~~ Better if Sorted, Then Redirected to a Separate File
- [x] Get CLI Arg to Sort 
- [ ] Get CLI Arg to Output to a File
- [ ] More Extensive Testing
